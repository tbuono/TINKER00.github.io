	<p>I am a Ph.D. student at MIT interested in cities. I develop measures of the built environment using new data crowdsourced from social media or collected by sensors and remote sensing. Using these measures, spatial data analysis techniques and visualization, I am studying how to improve social and economic outcomes in cities. My current research explores usage patterns of urban places over time, the role of amenities in urban vitality, and the role of firms in spurring regional economic development.</p>
